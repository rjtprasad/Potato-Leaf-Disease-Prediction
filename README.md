# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction
Farmers who grow potatoes are facing lot of economic losses every year because of various diseases that can happen to a potato plant. There are two common diseases known as early blight and late blight early blight is caused by a fungus and late blight is caused by a specific microorganism and if a farmer can detect these diseases early and apply appropriate treatment then it can save lot of waste and prevent the economic loss.
This project is about classifying and detecting leaf diseases in potato plants based on convolutional neural network.
